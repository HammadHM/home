		    <h4>The CPU has gone through vast arrays of technical achievements, 
		    <br>
		    CPU's nowadays are much faster with more cores and clock speed.
		    <br>
		    Here is a brief summary of the history:
		    </h4>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		    <h3>Basic Concept - 1823 and 1903</h3>
		    Pretty big gap of years, however the two fundamental concepts to create the modern CPU
		    <br>
		    happened in these two years. Firstly in 1823, Baron Jons Jackob Berzelius discovered
		    <br>
		    slicon, which as we know, is one of the most important material required to make a CPU.                                     
		    <br>
		    Also, in 1903, the famous Nikola Tesla patented his electrical logic circuit, which is the
		    <br>
		    essential basis of the CPU.

		    <h3>Discovery of Transistors - 1947 to 1960</h3>
		    At Bell Labatories, Willam Shockley, Walter Brattain and John Bardeen created the first
		    <br>
		    transistor, which amplifies or switch electrical signal, or power. The trio later
		    <br>
		    patented their product and each got a Nobel Peace Prize.

		    <br>
		    However, in 1958, the first integrated circuit was made by Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby,
		    <br>
		    an integrated circuit contains many logic gates, electrical pathways, and transistors.
		    <br>
		    IBM later created a mass-production facility for transistors in 1960.
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    <h3>Prime Time - 1968 to 1972</h3>
		    Intel was created by Robert Noyce & Gordon Moore in 1968 to become one of today's 2nd biggest 
		    <br>
		    semi-conductor company, and a year later Intel's competiton Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was 
		    <br>
		    created too.
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    In 1971, Intel introduces the Intel 4004, which was the first microprocessor! The 4004
		    <br>
		    started at $200 and included near 2,300 transistors, 640 bytes of memory and performed about
		    <br>
		    60,000 operations per second.

		    <h2 class="subt">With New technology...</h2>
		    Clock speed and Core counts have been increased, with that - CPU can process much quicker, be much smaller, 
		    <br>
		    contain more transistors and run more reliably.
