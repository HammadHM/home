		    <h4>Comparison of CPU using Budget; how to find your CPU</h4>
		    They're have been many CPU that have been released, and whenever someone is looking for a CPU,
		    the biggest looking point has been the price point. 
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    Here's a chart of data I made:
		      <table class="datable" border="1">

                    <br>

		    If the uses are similar to what you do - you might want to check the recommendations.
		    <br>
		    The pros and cons are there to give a clearer picture.
		    <br>
		    However, it is better to understand the specfications of a CPU - this will help your
		    <br>
		    interpretation of a CPU.
		    <h1 class="subt" >Understanding CPU specs</h1>
		    <h3>Cores</h3>
		    The CPU is made with micro-processors, also known as CPU cores, these microprocessors
		    <br>
		    are what do the calculations; meaning that more cores are what significantly boost your
		    <br>
		    computer's performance. The typical amount of cores are 4 cores.
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    <h3>Clock Speed</h3>
		    The CPU has to do a set number of instructions quickly to make the computer run
		    <br>
		    smoothly, the speed of the CPUs work cycle can be told by the Clock speed - usually
		    <br>
		    Ghz. Its not as important as core count, however it does matter. The typical speed
		    <br>
		    is 3.5Ghz-4.2Ghz.
		    <br> 
		    <br>
		    <h3>Cache</h3>
		    CPU cache is very fast on-board memory, much faster then RAM.
		    <br>
		    With more L3 Cache, your most often used programs are loaded much quicker.
		  
		</p>
		<p>
		    <h1 class="subt">Future Trends</h1>
		    The future trends of the CPUs are quite straightforward. More cores,
		    <br>
		    higher clock speed, and more cache. However, CPU's price trend seems to be going 
		    <br>
		    up. The materials, intensive research and mechanical machinary are going to make the price
		    <br>
		    go higher in the future.
