                <br>
            Usually sighted as the brain of the PC, the CPU has three 
            main parts that each have individual tasks to keep the computer running
            properly.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Here are the three parts:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Control Unit</li>
                <li>Arithmetic Logic Unit</li>
                <li>Cache</li>
            </ul>
            
            
        <p>
            <h4>Control Units</h4>
            The Control Unit or also known as CU is what commands the operations of the CPU
            and indicates how to respond to the instructions. 
            It follows the 3 step plan. Fetch, decode, execute. 
            The CPU fetches data from the memory,  then decodes the data for what it becomes signals that
            can be sent to other components to execute the CPU's data.
            <br>
            
            Here's a video to explain it by Abelardo Pardo:

            <br>
            <h4>Arithmetic Logic Unit</h4>
            <p>
                The Arithmetic Logic Unit also known as ALU is what performs the bit-shifting,
                logical and arithmetic calculations, it follows the Control Units request.
                <br>
                The ALU decodes and executes the data requested, making it a substanial
                part of the Central Processing Unit.
                <br>
                Here is a simple 4-bit ALU example:

                <h4>Cache</h4>
                Where instructions and data can be copied and retrived using high-speed memory
                <br>

                <h1 class="subt">Category of Component</h1>
                The CPU can be classified as a Direct Data Entry input, output, processing, and storage component.
                <br>
                <br>
                Subsequently, CPU has to manage various components; which will require to input signals to alert
                other components to perform their tasks. 
                <br>
                The CPU doesn't always require human interactions to do its tasks
                making it an DDE input component.
                Also, the executing, and outputing makes it an output component.
                <br>
                <br>
                The CPU is also an processing component, as said by the name, and the CPU can be considered a 
                storage device due to its cache memory.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here's the first diagram for the next topic:

                <h1 class="subt">How does it work and what materials are used</h1>
                <a href="#top">Refer to the "Functionalites" Section to see how it functions</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Essentially, the CPU fetches information from the memory, then is decoded to be processed,
                <br>
                and then finally is executed and outputed.
                <br>
                <br>
                The CPU requires some hefty materials, which is why the CPU is one of the most expensive component in a PC.
                <br>
                CPUs requires 99.99% pure silicon crystal, with doping materials - this is due to silicons easy-to-manipulate
                <br>
                conductive properties.
                <br>
                Tiny amounts of gold and copper are used to conduct electricity pathways.
                <br>
                CPU's also use epoxy resins and fiber glass back board.
